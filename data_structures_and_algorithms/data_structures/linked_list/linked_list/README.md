# Singly Linked List
### A linked list is a linear data structure, it is a group of nodes liked to each other using pointers the first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail the tail points at null (nothing) because there is not value after it

## Challenge
### The challenge was mainly about accessing the linked list and move between nodes and add befor and after  and print

## Approach & Efficiency
### I used the classes to create a linked list or to insert a new value to it,also if i want  to find if a spsefic value exsist in the linked list or not .
### the class was O(1)
## API
### The methods used are:
1. Insert method :which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the head of the list.

2. str method: which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List.

3. Includes method: which takes any value as an argument and returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
4. Append method :which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the end of the list.

5. Insert_before method :which Add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node.

6. Insert_after method :  which Add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node.
